Currently, the church is known for housing 2500 families and is one of those Alleppey tourist places that are popularly visited by the masses. The church organizes two feasts or festivals every year. The first one of them is St. Mary’s Feast. Since the church is dedicated to the Virgin Mary, hence every year on the third Sunday of September, a feast is organized by the Church. People visit the church on this day and participate in the festival wearing special costumes for the procession and mass.
        
        The other feast celebrated here is St. Sebastian’s Feast. Fireworks and other dazzling display of colors make this feast remarkable, interesting and fun. The gorgeous decorations, feast and regal look of the church make it one of the best places to visit in Alleppey.
